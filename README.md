# Text-Analysis-using-NLP
This project covers a full text analysis workflow. It includes web scraping for data acquisition, preprocessing, and feature extraction. The core involves data extraction &amp; calculations for insights, using NLP tasks like sentiment analysis. Developed in Python (NLTK/spaCy) and presented as a Jupyter Notebook.
Description of files:
1.	MasterDictionary: Contains POSITIVE WORDS AND NEGATIVE WORDS DICTIONARIES 

2. StopWords: Contains STOPWORDS files

3. text files: File for storing text files of the relevant data scrapped from the webpages named as per their URL_ID.

4. Approach towards the solution.ipynb: All the tests and trials done to reach the solution are present in this file

5. Text_Analysis.ipynb: Final Text analysis .ipyb file containing the final solution for the given problem
To run it use jupyter notebook

6. bctech2011: File made to validate the approach or find the mistakes

7. bctech2011.txt: file made to validate the approach or find the mistakes

8. Final output data.xlsx: Final solution reached with the help of 5th file. It’s an excel file

9. Input.xlsx: Input datafile containing URL_ID and URL

10. Objective.docx: Problem Statement

11. Output Data Structure.xlsx: Preview for the final output

12: Text Analysis.docx: File containing the brief description of the variables and their formula.

13. Text_Analysis.py: .py file for the final solution

    HOW TO RUN .py FILE:
    Step 1: Visit the folder and then reach out to the file path bar at                 		the top.
     
    
	Step 2: Click on this path bar and type cmd and press enter	 to 	open command prompt

 

               Step 3: Python should already be installed in the system and to                check whether it is installed or not type python –version in the command prompt.
